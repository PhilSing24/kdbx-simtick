A PyKX notebook is provided to help you get started quickly. It walks through loading the module, running a simulation with a preset, and plotting the results — useful if you're new to PyKX or want to verify everything is working.

### Setup

cd di/simtick
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements.txt
